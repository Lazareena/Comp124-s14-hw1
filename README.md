Problem 2: Unit Conversions
---

I have created a `UnitConversions` class that converts temperatures. Unfortunately, it's broken: it always returns zero!

1. Implement the conversion methods correctly, so that the tests in `UnitConversionsTest` all pass.
   (**The tests are already correct.** You only need to change the code in `UnitConversions`.)
2. Using the temperature methods as an example, add your own pair of methods to convert back
   and forth between two units of your choice.
3. Add tests for your new methods to `UnitConversionsTest`.
